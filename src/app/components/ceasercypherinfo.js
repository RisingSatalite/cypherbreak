            <p>The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.
It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.
The Caesar cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
Evidence exists that Julius Caesar also used more complicated systems.
Caesar ciphers can be found today in childrens toys such as secret decoder rings.
